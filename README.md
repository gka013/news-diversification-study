Similarity-based personalization is generally assumed to boost engagement in recommender systems. However, is this also true beyond a single session in a news recommender?  

Amid concerns about filter bubbles and preference volatility, we propose an empirical evaluation of both short-term and longer-term effects of a news recommender system with two phases of data collection:  
- **Phase 1**: Initial preference elicitation and evaluation  
- **48-hour interval**  
- **Phase 2**: Personalized follow-up  

We compared two recommendation strategies in a preliminary longitudinal experiment (**N = 166**):  
- **Aligned feed**: Articles that met a ‚â•70% cosine-similarity threshold  
- **Disaligned feed**: Articles with only a 30% similarity threshold  

We collected:  
- **Behavioral metrics**: Article clicks, time on feed  
- **Evaluative metrics**: Self-reported familiarity, perceived recommendation quality, choice satisfaction, topic preferences  

**Findings:**  
- The *Aligned* feed was perceived to have more familiar content, while perceived diversity did not differ between strategies.  
- Users clicked on significantly fewer articles in Phase 2, particularly in the *Disaligned* condition.  
- We explored the volatility of topic preferences but did not observe significant differences across phases.  

**Conclusion:**  
Short-term increases in feed‚Äìprofile similarity can enhance familiarity and maintain behavioral engagement (i.e., clicks). However, they do not lead to higher levels of perceived quality and choice satisfaction ‚Äî raising doubts about the relationship between preference-based similarity and user satisfaction.
