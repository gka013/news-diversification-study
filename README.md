## üìñ Abstract  
Similarity-based personalization is generally assumed to boost engagement in recommender systems. However, is this also true beyond a single session in a news recommender? Amid concerns about filter bubbles and preference volatility, we propose an empirical evaluation of both short-term and longer-term effects of a news recommender system with two phases of data collection: Initial preference elicitation and evaluation (Phase 1), a 48-hour interval, and a personalized follow-up (Phase 2). We compared two recommendation strategies in a preliminary longitudinal experiment ($N = 166$): An \textbf{`Aligned'} feed that included articles that met a $\geq70\%$ cosine‚Äêsimilarity threshold, and a \textbf{`Disaligned'} feed with only a 30\% similarity threshold. We collected behavioral metrics (article clicks, time on feed) and evaluative metrics (self-reported familiarity, perceived recommendation quality, choice satisfaction, topic preferences) in both phases. The Aligned feed was perceived to have more familiar content, while perceived diversity did not differ between recommendation strategies. Users clicked on significantly fewer articles in Phase 2, particularly in the Disaligned condition. We also explored the volatility of topic preferences, but did not observe significant differences across phases. These findings suggest that short-term increases in feed‚Äìprofile similarity can enhance familiarity and maintain behavioral engagement (i.e., clicks). In contrast, they do not lead to higher levels of perceived quality and choice satisfaction, which raises doubts about the relationship between the similarity of preference-based articles and user satisfaction.
